Autorank is an automatic ranking plugin that allows you to set rank-ups that have requirements. You can create requirements that make certain a player has at least x amount of money or x minutes played.

### Usage
Inside the Paths.yml you will find the path you take as a player on EagleKnightRealm

To rank up as Citizen you will have to be in the group (rank) `Tourist`
If you have played the required amount of time (in this case `2 hours`, offline and AFK will not be counted as `played time`).

The result will be: You get a reward of $1000 and promoted to Citizen.
